title: Verus Software Interrogation
---
#### Why are we doing a software Interrogation of Verus?

* We want to know the Interrogation Points for the Solana Bridge

#### Relevant Questions

* [How do you run a Verus Ethereum Bridge?](.//How do you run a Verus Ethereum Bridge?.md)

#### General Question

* What data structure are blocks stored in?
* [What database does verus coin use?](.//What database does verus coin use?.md)
* [Where are the smart contracts for the Verus Ethereum Bridge?](.//Where are the smart contracts for the Verus Ethereum Bridge?.md)
* Where is the network code for Verus?

#### Brainstorming Logs

* It's written in Javascript
* Does the Verus Ethereum Bridge require both an Ethereum key and a Verus Key?
* The Verus Node requires staking therefore the node does the staking and the bridge just has the public key
* How does the Verus Bridge connect to the Verus Node?
* What does this mean?
	* [convertVerusAddressToEthAddress](https://github.com/monkins1010/Verusbridgekeeper/blob/main/utils.js#L80C7-L80C38)
	* So if this is the case does it mean you can use the same Mnemonic in Verus as Ethereum?
	* But Ethereum Hashes the public key, bitcoin has it's own weird stuff, I doubt this is the case
* Should we be trying to understand the bridge from the Smart Contract Primitive or from the calls to the Verus node?
* Smart contract is probably easier
* So I go look at the smart contract code and see, [blake2.sol](https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Ethereum-Contracts/blob/main/contracts/MMR/Blake2b.sol)
