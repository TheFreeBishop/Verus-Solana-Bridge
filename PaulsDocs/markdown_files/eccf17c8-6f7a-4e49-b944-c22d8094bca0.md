#### Logs

#### 2024-12-15T12:10:43-05:00

* TODO
	* Trace the variables in the below file to understand the integration points for Verus and Ethereum, [Verusbridgekeeper/veth.conf at 640a35306c02e6967656354270b416a034be905e Â· monkins1010/Verusbridgekeeper](https://github.com/monkins1010/Verusbridgekeeper/blob/640a35306c02e6967656354270b416a034be905e/veth.conf)
#### 2024-12-15T12:01:06-05:00

* Properly looked through the Verus Smart Contracts for the first time
* They are far more complicated than I expected, they are doing full on proper proofs of verus transactions in solidity, there is also an entire Delegation system for upgrading the smart contracts, there is a serializer and a deserializer
* If I want to be successful I need to read [Mastering Bitcoin](.//Mastering Bitcoin.md) and [Mastering Ethereum](.//Mastering Ethereum.md), I am getting overwhelmed after only 35 minutes over here
* Well that's because you never defined a specific task, interrogating software is too vauget
	* I wanted to know where the listener to Verus is and where the listener for Ethereum is and reverse engineer the data from there
	* What do I even search for in the Verus Bridge for what is being listened to?
	* Ohhh the RPC user pass and stuff like that are for Verus, and the Infura key is for Ethereum
	* Wow that took 40 minutes to realize
	* We gotta trace those later

* [Verus Software Interrogation](.//44b40bb7-b4fa-4832-8009-ef3499e89340.md)
* What is a software interrogation supposed to look like?
* We want to know the interrogation points

#### 2024-12-07T15:41:18-05:00

* Looks like you don't run a daemon 24/7 something else relays the transactions
#### 2024-12-07T15:36:06-05:00

* Wow it is difficult to find how they are listening to the bridge, I just want to find the RPC call
* Articulate what you are looking for
* I am looking for either how the bridge listens to new transactions via a RPC call or how the transactions are verified after they are listened to via the RPC call
*

* Okay where are the bridges?

* We need to get the block and it's proofs
* But we need to get a smart contract deployed as well
