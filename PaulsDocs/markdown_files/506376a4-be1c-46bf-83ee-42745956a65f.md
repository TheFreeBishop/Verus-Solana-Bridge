	* Looks like transactions for Wormhole are verified by a white list of Guardians that produce a VAA signature
	* I guess the people just trust the Guardians to relay messages?

	* Here we see the transaction getting signed, but what relay is it using
	* There is no RPC interface

	* This could not make it more clear in terms of how Guardians work

	* [VAAs | Wormhole Docs](https://wormhole.com/docs/learn/infrastructure/vaas/)
	* Yup they just accept a bunch of proofs
	* But if the proof was generated from first principals verified by Solana Validators we would not need to worry about signature validations

#### Questions

* [Where in the Wormhole smart contract is the Guardian validation?](.//Where in the Wormhole smart contract is the Guardian validation?.md)
	* The solidity contracts have a IWormhole.sol interface they seem to get this information from
